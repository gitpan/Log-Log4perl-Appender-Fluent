Log::Log4perl::Appender::Fluent

Log::Log4perl appender writing to Fluentd.

Good logging requires today a lot more than in Good Ol' Times[tm]. Each log
entry should have a structure and be machine-parseable. On the other hand,
there are lot of logging libraries that don't quite support structured logs
and only process flat strings.

Log::Log4perl::Appender::Fluent is a Log::Log4perl appender plugin that
provides output to Fluentd daemon. The plugin supports sending simple string
messages, but it works way better when is provided with Log::Message::JSON or
Log::Message::Structured object, because the structure of the message will be
preserved.
